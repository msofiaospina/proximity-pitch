Proximity Pitch 
Guide and inspiration for creating your own digital instrument

How it started:
	As part of Lawrence Hall of Science Production Studio, we are tasked with designing the exhibits that come onto the floor. We start off with discovering cool ideas, YouTube is a wonderful resource for discovery. Nerd Musician hostâ€™s a channel with DIY videos of exciting digital instruments, in particular we were attracted to the MIDI Theremin shown in Figure 1.
